## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Demo Login

For development and testing, use these demo credentials:
- **Email**: `demo@receiptly.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`

Or create a new account using the registration form.

## n8n Integration Workflow

The application integrates with n8n for AI-powered receipt analysis:

1. **Upload**: User uploads receipt image in React app
2. **Send to n8n**: Image converted to base64 and sent to n8n webhook
3. **AI Analysis**: n8n processes image using AI services (OpenAI Vision, Google Vision, etc.)
4. **Return Results**: n8n returns structured JSON with extracted receipt data
5. **Review & Edit**: User can review and modify the extracted information
6. **Save to Database**: Final data saved to PostgreSQL via backend API

### n8n Webhook Configuration

**Webhook URL**: Set `REACT_APP_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` in your `.env` file  
**Expected Format**: See `N8N_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed webhook setup

## API Integration

This frontend expects the following API endpoints:
